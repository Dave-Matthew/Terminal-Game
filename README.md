# Description
Gotta catch’em all…but fruit! is a game where players will catch fruits falling from the legendary sky with their baskets. However, fruit is not the only thing that will drop. Players must avoid every single bomb entering their basket, or else it will fully destroy the basket and game over. As time goes by, the speed of the falling fruit and the amount of the bomb will be increased. Each fruit has its own size and points, the bigger they are the more points you get! The player gets 3 lives at first and losing one fruit means losing 1 life while catching the bomb is a fatal mistake!

# Game Rules
1. Players will move the basket using their keyboard’s arrow key.
2. Losing 1 fruit means losing 1 life out of 3 lives given at the beginning of the game.
3. Catching a bomb will end the game.
4. Players must fit the varieties of fruits into their basket
5. Players must fit the basket size with different fruit sizes, or else it will deduct 1 life.
6. The longer you play, the faster it gets, and even more bombs will drop.
7. Each fruit will have different scores as well (e.g. Banana worth 3 points; watermelon worth 7 points, etc)

# Features
1. The random element of this game will be the frequency, speed, and the type of things that are dropping(different types of fruits and bombs).
2. In this game, we will use a data structure to store the score of players and display the high score. We will also make a variety of fruits to catch, with each of them having different points. 
3. The process of catching the fruits will involve dynamic memory management, as after the fruit is caught, it will be removed from the array.
4. The input is the most recent player's score, and the output is the highest score once the game concludes.
5. Each feature will be separated into its own file, which will then be imported into the main file, which will be executed.
