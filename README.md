## Description
Gotta Catch’em All…But Fruit! is a game where players will catch fruits falling from the legendary sky with their basket. Fruits will drop randomly with a certain velocity. However, as the score increases, the speed of the falling fruit will be increased. The player gets 3 lives at first and losing one fruit means losing 1 life.

## Game Rules
1. Players will move the basket using their keyboard’s arrow key or 'A' and 'D' key.
2. Losing 1 fruit means losing 1 life out of 3 lives given at the beginning of the game.
3. Players must fit the fruits into their basket.
4. The longer you play, the faster it gets, making it more challenging to catch the fruits.

## Features
1. The random element of this game will be the frequency, speed, and the location where the fruits will be generated.
2. In this game, we will use a data structure to store the score of players and display the top 3 high score.
3. Pressing 'R' means resseting the whole scoreboard hence erasing all the highscore history.
4. The process of catching the fruits will involve dynamic memory management, as after the fruit is caught, it will be removed from the vector.
5. The input is the most recent player's score, and the output is the highest score once the game concludes.
6. Each feature will be separated into its own file, which will then be imported into the main file, which will be executed.
